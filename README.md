# Santoku

Thank you to the https://github.com/rebornix/vscode-webview-react
project for providing a starting point for this React app,
and tips on how to integrate it into VSCode.

VSCode integration is not handled in this repository. The
Santoku editor is meant to be pluggable into arbitrary IDEs.
To see the code that integrates it with VSCode, check out
https://github.com/andrewhead/vscode-santoku.

## Development

Run following commands in the terminal

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Then to test standalone (which will only provide a small
subset of the functionality...), run:

```bash
npm run start
```
